# Coding style

We adhere to [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/), which is automatically
enforced via a pre-commit in the CI.

Please check your code manually before committing. Suggestions for how to perform these
checks, as well as additional information about the checks performed, can be found in
the [developer guide](https://stfc.github.io/aiida-mlip/developer_guide).
