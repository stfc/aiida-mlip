# Contribution workflow and the review process

This document outlines the best practice, using git and CI, which **must** be followed
for all contributions to `aiida-mlip`. Also contained are instructions and tips for
managing your fork of the project, which will help keep merges clean and avoid many
headaches.

Please read our
[developer documentation](https://stfc.github.io/aiida-mlip/developer_guide)
for more technical details relating to contributions.

## Golden rules

In brief the rules for contribution are as follows:

- Follow the branch, fix, merge model, from your own fork or fork/branch model
- An issue should be created for every piece of work
- Pull/merge requests will not be accepted without a review
- New features must have a test
- All tests must pass, no regressions may be merged

## Issues

### Using issues

- Open an issue for each piece of work done, using the appropriate issue template
- Open issues for design discussions. The answers may be important for newer members
- When adding features, use comments to provide succinct reports on progress

### Labels

Labels may be assigned to issues to help classify them. Examples include:

- `bug`: something is not working as expected. We typically aim to fix these ASAP
- `enhancement`: adding or improving on features
- `testing`: adding or enhancing unit testing or CI
- `documentation`: adding or enhancing documentation
- `question`: Something is unclear

## Pull requests

### Creating pull requests

- Each pull request should aim to resolve an open issue
- Relevant questions and discussions should be noted in the pull request, even if
  discussed elsewhere, as these may be useful for reference or other developers
- Creating draft pull requests as early as possible is encouraged, to track progress,
  and so early feedback can be given

### Labels

As with issues, labels may be assigned to issues to help classify them.

## Review

All merge requests will be reviewed to ensure the integrity of the code.

The reviewer(s) have the following responsibilities:

- Ensuring all contribution rules have been followed
- Ensuring the [coding style](./coding_style.md) is adhered to
- Only accepting a merge if all tests have passed
- Using the comments system to request changes for the submitter to make

### Enforcing style

GitHub Actions will automatically run a pre-commit and enforce the coding style. To
reduce the number of CI failures, please run the pre-commit locally before you push to
your repository.

```sh
   pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Using git for development

The GitHub instance hosts an *upstream* repository, which we will refer to as
*upstream*. Contributors will work on their own personal copies of the repository by
creating *forks*. This allows us to keep *upstream* clean, while users may work on
their own *fork*, creating commits and changing the code as they see fit. Only in
exceptional circumstances are branches allowed in *upstream*.

The *upstream* repository may be cloned as follows,

``` sh
git clone git@github.com:stfc/aiida-mlip.git
```

A *fork* is created using the web UI. It may then be cloned for a user called
'username' as follows:

``` sh
git clone git@github.com:username/aiida-mlip.git aiida-mlip-username
```

or added as an alternative origin in the *upstream* cloned repository:

``` sh
git remote add username git@github.com:username/aiida-mlip.git
```

### Branch, fix, merge model:

All work should follow the workflow of branch, fix, merge. Let us assume you have an
issue with your code which needs to be fixed.

#### Step 1: Branch from your fork

Create a new branch for the issue on the dashboard of your fork, we will assume the
branch is called 'fix-xyz'. Clone the branch,

``` sh
$ git clone -b fix-xyz --single-branch git@github.com:username/aiida-mlip.git aiida-mlip-fix-xyz
```

Alternatively you can create the branch in the CLI using

``` sh
# clone the repository, if you already have a local repository this is not nessecary
$ git clone git@github.com:username/aiida-mlip.git aiida-mlip-fix-xyz
$ pushd aiida-mlip-fix-xyz
# create and checkout a new branch (this is equivalent to git branch followed by git checkout)
$ git checkout -b fix-xyz
# create a remote tracking branch for you to push your changes to
$ git push -u origin fix-xyz
```

#### Step 2: Fix the issue and commit your changes

Fix whatever is wrong. Use `git status` to see which files you have
changed and prepare a commit.

``` sh
# stage changes
$ git add <filename|folder>   # to add the new things
# commit the changes with a clear and brief message
$ git commit -m "<commit message>"
# push the commit to origin
$ git push
```

#### Step 3a: Merge your branch into upstream

Follow the provided link after the push and continue to the web interface. Add any
relevant labels or milestones and assign a reviewer. Compare the code and if you are
happy click to submit your pull request.

After the pull request has been submitted, tests will be run and your reviewer will be
notified.

#### Step 3b: Finalising the merge

If all is OK with the commit your reviewer may set the request to be merged once all
tests pass. Otherwise, the reviewer may open discussions using the GitHub comment
system to point out issues that may need to be addressed before the commit can be
merged.

If changes need to be made you may make more commits onto your branch. When you push
your branch to your *fork* the pull request will be automatically updated to use the
latest commit. Reply to the discussions to indicate when and how they have been
addressed.

If your branch has become out of sync with *upstream* then conflicts may arise.
Sometimes these cannot be automatically resolved and you will need to resolve them by
hand. GitHub provides instructions for this, or you can follow this routine,

``` sh
# add upstream as a remote if you have not already
$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:stfc/aiida-mlip.git
# get the changes to upstream since you started working on your issue
$ git fetch upstream
# merge these changes into your branch (assuming you want to merge into the main branch on upstream)
$ git merge upstream/main
# resolve any conflicts
# push to your fork
$ git push
```

Alternatively you may use rebase which will replay the changes you made in your branch
on top of *upstream/main*. However, be sure you understand the differences between
merge and rebase.

``` sh
# add upstream as a remote if you have not already
$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:stfc/aiida-mlip.git
# get the changes to upstream since you started working on your issue
$ git fetch upstream
# merge these changes into your branch (assuming you want to merge into the main branch on upstream)
$ git rebase -i upstream/main
# resolve any conflicts
# push to your fork
$ git push
```


### Advanced git

#### Keeping your fork in sync with project

By adding two remotes, one for *upstream* and one for your *fork* it is possible to
keep your *fork* in sync with *upstream*. This will greatly simplify merge requests.
GitHub also offers a sync functionality in their web UI that achieves the same.

``` sh
# clone your fork
$ git clone git@github.com:username/aiida-mlip.git aiida-mlip-username
pushd aiida-mlip-username
# add a remote for upstream
$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:stfc/aiida-mlip.git
```

These commands need to be done only once. `git remote -v` shall show you
the origin and project fetch and push links

``` sh
$ git remote -v
origin  git@github.com:username/aiida-mlip.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:username/aiida-mlip.git (push)
upstream git@github.com:stfc/aiida-mlip.git (fetch)
upstream git@github.com:stfc/aiida-mlip.git (push)
```

When you need to sync your *fork* with *upstream*, do the following,

``` sh
# get the latest commits from upstream
$ git fetch upstream
# ensure you are in the main branch of your fork
$ git checkout main
# merge your main branch into the main branch of upstream
$ git merge upstream/main
# push these changes back to the remote of your fork (origin)
$ git push
```

Of course, one can use a similar process to merge any other branch or available
projects.

#### Rebasing commits

When working on an issue you may use multiple commits. When you are ready to create a
merge request, you should squash your changes into one commit in order to keep
*upstream* clean. This is most easily achieved with an interactive rebase.

Assuming you have made five commits,

``` sh
# rebase your branch five commits before HEAD i.e. where your branch originally diverged
$ git rebase -i HEAD~5
# follow the instructions. 'pick' the first commit then 'sqaush' or 'fixup' the rest.
# You should now be left with a single commit containing all your changes
# Push your commmit to the remote, use --force-with-lease if you have already pushed this branch to
# 'rewrite history'
$ git push origin branchname --force-with-lease
```

Using force is a powerful and dangerous option, use it only if you know 150% nobody
else touched that branch.

#### Cleaning stale branches

Deleting branches from the web interface will get rid of the remotes and not of your
local copies. The local branches left behind are called stale branches. To get rid of
them:

``` sh
$ git remote prune origin
```

To delete a local branch:

``` sh
$ git branch -d localBranch
```

If unmerged commits exists, but you still want to delete the branch, use:

``` sh
$ git branch -D localBranch
```

To delete a remote branch on the remote *origin* use:

``` sh
$ git push -d origin remoteBranch
```

## Code Coverage

Ensure that any code you add does not reduce the code coverage in a meaningful way.
Reviewers may insist on new test to be added. Please cooperate.
